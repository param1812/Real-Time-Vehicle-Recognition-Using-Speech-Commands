# Small-Tutorial-On-Vehicles
## ABSTRACT
  This project focuses on developing a speech recognition system that can transcribe speech in real time. Our system, a small tutorial on vehicles, provides a speech-based solution to display the image of the particular vehicle that is spoken. Our system basically helps the user to get to see and check the results for certain vehicles and it also provides the provision to add a new vehicle name by using the live training option. The system is trained on a dataset of vehicle name recordings and is able to handle different accents and dialects. It uses the concepts of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for creating the models for different vehicle names and characterizing them when tested. The system is developed in C/C++ in Visual Studio IDE. For the time being the system is limited to detecting only a few numbers of vehicle names, however, further extensions can be easily made to support a greater number of vehicle names.

## EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
  The basic requirements for this project are as follows-
  * Windows OS
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
  * C++11 integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio(VS) 2010
  * Recording Module

## CONCLUSION
  Our project introduces a speech recognition system that instantly transcribes spoken words into a text format, providing a user-friendly tutorial on vehicles. By using Hidden Markov Models, we've created a reliable system that identifies vehicle names and displays corresponding images. The system's vocabulary can be expanded through live training, and there's potential to enhance its efficiency and integrate it with other applications in the future.
